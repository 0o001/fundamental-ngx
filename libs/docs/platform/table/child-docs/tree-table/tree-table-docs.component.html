<description>
    This example shows tree table usage. To setup tree table use next properties:

    <ul>
        <li><code>[isTreeTable]</code> Whether tree mode enabled or no.</li>
        <li><code>[relationKey]</code> Name of the field in the object which contains children nodes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Drag & Drop</h3>

    <p>Tree table supports mouse Drag & Drop by default, so rows can be moved & placed inside other rows.</p>
    <p>
        Drag & Drop events are simply client-side events and any desired backend changes must be handled by catching the
        <code>(rowsRearrange)</code> event.
    </p>

    <p>
        Drag and drop is available via keyboard by focusing a row or cell, holding the alt/option key and using the up
        or down arrows.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, keyboard drag & drop works in shift mode, which means that focused item will ne moved on the same
        level as it's siblings.
    </p>
    <p>
        By pressing alt/option + shift key, drag & drop will use 'group' mode with the next sibling based on the
        direction of drag & drop.
    </p>
    <p>Drag and drop can be disabled by setting the <code>[enableRowReordering]</code> input to <code>false</code>.</p>

    <h3>Tree initialization</h3>
    <p>
        Tree can be initialized and and its state can be controlled by the application. In order to do this tree needs
        be instantiated using <code>TableRow</code> interface, where application set initial state. Selection can be set
        by using the <code>[selectedKey]</code> and <code>[selectableKey]</code> inputs. See
        <a routerLink="/platform/table/row-selection">row selection</a> for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also set <code>[enableTristateMode]</code>, to propagate selection from children to parents and parent
        to children.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tree row expansion can be handled by using the <code>[expandedStateKey]</code> input. The table also has the
        <code>[expandOnInit]</code> boolean input which will expand all rows when the table first loads.
    </p>
