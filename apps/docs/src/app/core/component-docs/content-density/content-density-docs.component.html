    Content Density can be maintained app-wide using the <code>ContentDensityService</code>, and components can
    subscribe to a <code>BehaviorSubject </code> managed by the service and use that to handle changes to the content
    density. Before using it, you should add <code>ContentDensityService</code> to the <code>providers</code> array of
    <code>AppModule</code>, or other root modules in your application.<br />
    Note that many components only come in one size, and others (such as the button below) only have compact and cozy
    sizes, so setting the size to condensed will have the same effect as compact.<br />

    All components with content density options will check to see if the developer has provided a compact input value.
    If not, it will then refer to the value set in the <code>ContentDensityService</code>.
